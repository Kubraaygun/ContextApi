# User and Task Management Application with Context API

This project, which I prepared using React Native and Context API, is designed to learn how to easily manage data sharing between components. The Context API allows for centralized management of data used throughout the application and ensures it can be easily passed to the relevant components.

## Project Purpose

The purpose of this project is to learn how to manage user and task data within the application using Context API, and how to transfer this data between components.

## Features

- User Management (UserContext):

  - User data is fetched from the JSON Placeholder API and managed with UserContext.
  - User data is displayed as a list, and details of a selected user can be accessed.

- Task Management (TaskContext):

Tasks can be added, deleted, and listed.
Task data is managed with TaskContext and shared between components.
